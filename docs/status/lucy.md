# Lucy status (services/credit, Quicknode)

## Done
- Phase 0: verified Quicknode XRPL support from their docs, wrote docs/QUICKNODE.md.
- Phase 1: contracts in contracts/credit (profile, profiles_batch, events_sse,
  credit_events_internal, watch, streams_webhook, explain, link). FastAPI
  skeleton in services/credit with GET /health, GET /profile/{network}/{address},
  POST /profiles, GET /events (SSE). MOCK=1 (default) returns the contract
  examples labeled simulated. pytest, mypy and ruff pass.
- Phase 2: read-only JSON-RPC client (credit/xrpl_client.py): account_info,
  account_lines and account_tx (newest first, follows the marker, stops at
  ACCOUNT_TX_MAX_PAGES and reports truncated), plus first_tx for account age.
  Raw responses cached in SQLite (credit/db.py), keyed by network, source,
  method and params. Backoff with retry on HTTP 429/5xx and rippled
  slowDown/tooBusy, honoring Retry-After. Only read methods are allowed, so
  the client cannot submit a transaction. Smoke-tested live against public
  testnet and mainnet.

## Next
- Phase 3: features, Moonshift loan history, points scorecard, confidence.

## Blockers
- No `.env` in the repo yet, so `QUICKNODE_XRPL_MAINNET_URL` and
  `QUICKNODE_XRPL_TESTNET_URL` are unset. The service falls back to public
  XRPL endpoints and labels every response `source: "public"` until a human
  adds them.

## Decisions
- Live monitoring uses Quicknode Streams as the primary path (Lucy's call):
  ledger dataset, a JS filter that checks a Quicknode Key-Value Store
  watchlist, delivered to the credit service's signed webhook receiver. A
  Quicknode WebSocket `subscribe` on `accounts` is the fallback
  (`MONITOR_MODE=websocket`) if Streams is not on our plan.
- Followed the Lucy prompt's branch rule (commit and push to `lucy`) over the
  root CLAUDE.md, which is written for Alexander's own session (`alex` branch).
- Contract JSON uses camelCase (address, readOnly, asOf), matching apps/api.
  XRP amounts in profiles are XRP decimal strings with 6 decimals.
- Mock tx hashes are obvious placeholders (000...001) so nobody mistakes them
  for real transactions.
- Cache TTL is 15 minutes for latest data (account_info, first account_tx
  page). Older account_tx pages and the oldest-tx lookup never change, so they
  are cached forever. `?refresh=1` re-fetches the latest data.
- History depth is capped at 10 pages of 200 (2,000 newest txs) to stay well
  under the free-plan credit budget; profiles say `truncated: true` when hit.
- The service loads services/credit/.env, then the repo root .env, without
  ever printing them. Tests blank the Quicknode vars so they never hit the network.
